## Installation

1. Clone this repository and, recursively, all submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ethho/dotfiles
```

2. `git fetch --all` and `git checkout` the branch with the desired config.

3. Run the [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) install script:

```bash
dotfiles/install.sh
```

3. Remove files in `$HOME` that were not replaced with symlinks, and re-run the install script.
4. Some files in the root config may fail to link. This is expected; simply link or copy them manually.
